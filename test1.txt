I was born in 10th October 1998.
And I have passed SSC exam in 2015.
I have completed my HSC in 2017.
May be i will complete my BA degree in 2023 by the grace of Almighty Allah. It could be in 2022 but have failed for COVID-19 pandamic.
If Allah wants then i will be able to complete my MA degree in 2024.

I actually want to start earning as soon as possible because want to marry my favourite person if Allah wants.
